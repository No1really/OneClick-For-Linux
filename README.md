## ✨ My Ethos

> “Perfection isn’t about adding more,  
> it’s about removing the unnecessary.”

- **Intentional Choices:** Every detail matters.  
- **Quiet Mastery:** True skill is felt, not announced.  
- **Human Touch:** Even technology deserves a heartbeat.  
- **Timeless Style:** Trends fade; fundamentals endure.
